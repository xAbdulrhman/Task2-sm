# Task2-sm
this should be the second repository here and I thought I'll just leave it, but now, I had to it because of my university training requier :( <br>
this repository is to the Smart Methods and It's about robot control panel that we can use to make the robot move online <3
<br>
forgive my laziness, but this is for my summer training ^^ 
<br>
*NOTE for s-m *: the "not important" files are the first task files, so yeah
